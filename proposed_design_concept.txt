Class of Users:
    Our class of users are high school and college students.  This class likes
    to not only listen to music, but also read news about specific artists and
    newly released singles and albums.  Furthermore, these students like to
    read album reviews and blog articles about their favorite artists.
    Ideally, the users would like all of this information to be displayed
    neatly on an artist page and would like to manage a group of their favorite
    artists.

Personas:
    1. Jamie is a college student studying Environmental Engineering.  She
       likes to listen to music while she's going to class and while working
       on her problem sets.  During her down time, she enjoys keeping tabs
       on all her favorite artists, especially Future Islands.
    2. Rafa is a journalist student focusing on covering music.  He uses many
       different web sources, but he has yet to find one site that can provide
       all his music-related news needs.  He uses many news/blog articles and
       album reviews for his own writing but wants to spend less time searching
       on search engines.

       click the plus button next to their name.  She sees that Future Islands
       has been added to the list in the subnav bar.
