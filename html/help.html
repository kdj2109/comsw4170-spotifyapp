		<p class="help">Our app is here to help you, the user, keep up with all the news from your favorite artists. You can search for your favorite artists, track and untrack them and even listen to their music, all within our app! Tracking an artist adds their news content to your feed and adds all of their buzz to your personalized <button class="md-raised md-button md-default-theme mouse" ng-disabled="{{true}}"><a class="header-tab ng-scope mouse">My Artists</a><div class="md-ripple-container"></div></button> page. On that page you can look at the news you saw on the newsfeed, as well as blog posts and reviews, all while listening to their music!
