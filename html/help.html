		<p>Our app is here to help you, the user, keep up with all the news from your favorite artists. You can search for your favorite artists, track and untrack them and even listen to their music, all within our app! Tracking an artist adds their news content to your feed and adds all of their buzz to your personalized ‘My Artists’ page. On the ‘My Artists’ page you can look at the news you saw on the newsfeed, as well as blog posts and reviews, all while listening to their music! We hope that our app is easy to use but for those just getting started here are some helpful hints!</p>

		<p>Search Artist: To search an artist simply type their name into the search bar on the top of the page. A scrollable dropdown will be autopopulated with artists that match your search. Simply click their name and you will be brought to their artist news page.</p>

		<p>Track Artist: To track an artist click <i class="fa fa-plus-circle fa-lg green" tabindex="0"></i> next to their name on their artist page after searching them. You can also track them directly from the search bar dropdown by clicking <i class="fa fa-plus-circle fa-lg green" tabindex="0"></i>. They will now appear in your newsfeed and on your ‘My Artists’ page.</p>

		<p>Untrack Artist: To untrack an artist navigate to your <button class="md-raised md-button md-default-theme" ng-transclude=""><a class="header-tab ng-scope" href="#/artists">My Artists</a><div class="md-ripple-container"></div></button> page. Click <i class="fa fa-pencil" tabindex="0"></i> to edit your list and click <i class="fa fa-trash-o" tabindex="0"></i> to remove them from your list. Finally, click <i class="fa fa-check-circle" tabindex="0"></i> to confirm your edits. You can also untrack them through the search bar dropdown or from their artist page by clicking <i class="fa fa-minus-circle fa-lg red float-right" tabindex="0"></i>. Untracked artists will no longer show up in your newsfeed or on your ‘My Artists’ page.</p>
